The information is tracked for routine administration, maintenance purposes and operation of certain features of the application.

Advertising partners and other third parties may use cookies, scripts and/or web beacons to track user activities on this app in order to display advertisements and other useful information. Such tracking is done directly by the third parties through their own servers and is subject to their own privacy policies. This app has no access or control over these cookies, scripts and/or web beacons that may be used by third parties.

## Links to Third Party Websites

I have included links on this app for your use and reference. I are not responsible for the privacy policies on these websites. You should be aware that the privacy policies of these websites may differ from my own.

## Security

The security of your personal information is important to me. The data is stored on a Virtual Private Server, accessed only by me as the sole owner. The data is encrypted.
